The git repo contains code for generation of excel sheets in a couple of formats, the one is denoting the particular service offered by a particular vendor -
if yes then it will visualize yes in excel sheet otherwise no.
Another is the prices or the total cost a vendor is taking from us to deliver a particular service. 
The main.py file contains driver code and the extracted data from a number of excel sheets
The Report folder contains Report.py and PricesReport.py files which are used for the above stated purpose.
